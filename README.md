## Rules:

### EventStartMeeting
Use this time to set up yourself and get ready to start coding.
You can also discuss some ideas with others and decide what you'll be doing.

### Sprint[1-6]
Each sprint has 45 minutes. During this time, we will be at the working room. NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO TALK!! 
During the sprint time, it's absolutely against the rules to talk, not even to ask for anything. If you need to say something, you have to save it to the #CoffeBreak

### CoffeBreak
Each coffe break has 15 minutes. During this time we will have some coffe, juices, cookies and others.
Use this time to talk to others and rest a little.

### LunchTime
This is the time to regain the force we lost while exercising the fingers. We're going to eat some pizza, drink some coke and laught at the bugs we just made :)

### CodeReviewMeeting
The last meeting is where everyone will brefily show what have they acomplished, the changes they made to the project (if so) and if it went as they were expecting at the #EventStartMeeting or not.

### ByeByeHandShake
Well, unfortunately we have to go back to the real world, and we're going to do that at 07h:00 am
