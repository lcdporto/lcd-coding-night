# LCD Coding Night.

Remember that project you have been talking about for so long, but haven't started yet?

Now it's time to do something about it!

Come and spend an entire night coding with us.

At Feb 19 at 23h:00, we're going to meet at LCD as an iniciative to kick-start / work on projects. 
During this event we're going to follow some rules and some strict schedule. The main objective is to see how can we increase our productivity by spliting the the "focused-working" time and the "talking-thinking" time.
In order for that to work, we're going to have 6 sprints of focused-working time, having each of them 45 minutes.
At the end of each sprint, we're going to have 15 minutes coffe break, where you can mentally prepare for your next sprint, drink some coffe and exchange ideas with your collegues.

During the sprints, we are going to be working at the Working Room. As we all know, the limit of people working on this room is * 10 participants *. Each participant will start with 3 tokens of good will. Whenever a rule is broken, 1 token will be removed from him. If all tokens are removed from this participant, he will be kicked out of the working room by Bieber

If you have a project that you would like to work at the Oficina Room, it will be open during the event too. You still have to follow the schedule. The limit for this room will be * 5 participants *

The price of the subscription is 10â‚¬, which is consumable at the coffebreaks and lunch-time

## Rules:

### #EventStartMeeting
Use this time to set-up yourself and get ready to start coding.
You can also discuss some ideas with others and decide what you'll be doing.

### #Sprint[1-6]
Each sprint has 45 minutes. During this time, we will be at the working room. NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO TALK!! 
During the sprint time, it's absolutely against the rules to talk, not even to ask for anything. If you need to say something, you should save it to the #CoffeBreak, or use Lena chat available at: http://talk.audienciazero.net/lcdporto/

### #CoffeBreak
Each coffe break has 15 minutes. During this time we will have some coffe, juices, cookies and others.
Use this time to talk to others and rest a little.

### #LunchTime
This is the time to regain the force we lost while exercising the fingers. We're going to eat some pizza, drink some coke and laught at the bugs we just made :)

### #CodeReviewMeeting
The last meeting is where everyone will brefily show what have they acomplished, the changes they made to the project (if so)  and if it went as they were expecting at the #EventStartMeeting or not.

### #ByeByeHandShake
Well, unfortunately we have to go back to the real world, and we're going to do that at 07h:00 am
